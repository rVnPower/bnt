# Preface
This is an add-on that was inspired by [nightly](https://github.com/damnitharshit/nightly).
The only purpose of this project is to make my new tab looks better.

I will also wrote a blog on how to make this. Soon it will be here.

# Installation
This add-on should work on every Chrome-based browser. Firefox-based browsers are not tested.

1. Download the source code by cloning this repository or download and extract the .zip file above.
2. Go to your browser's extension page. Example: chrome://extensions/
3. Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch on the top right.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button on the top left.
5. Select the source code folder you just downloaded from step 1.
6. Enable the extension and disable any extension that may conflict with it.
7. That's it! Now try to open a new tab.

# About configuring
Sadly, due to the CORS policy, configuration will not be easy to make. I tried fetching some JSON file but I could not get rid of the errors.
~~The only way you can configure this project is to modify the source code and build.~~

Working on it with localStorage! Stay tuned!
